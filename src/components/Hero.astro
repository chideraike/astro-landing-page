      This is the primary preliminary space for a user to make contact and
      know you. Here you will list a key phrase or description of your business,
      or an introductory offer that will hopefully persuade them to sit and talk
      with you. As many as a third of visitorsâ€™ attention are spent on the
      landing page. They are typically long and with several references to what
      your business offers.
